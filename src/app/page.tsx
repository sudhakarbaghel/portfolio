        Hello, I'm Sudhakar Singh Baghel, a passionate and skilled software
        engineer with expertise in various technologies. I hold a B.Tech degree
        in Electronics & Communication Engineering from Lakshmi Narain College

        database management systems like MySQL and MongoDB. Additionally, I have
        experience in working with popular frameworks and libraries such as
        Nexts.js, React.js, Node.js, Typescript, Redux, and Scss.

        actively engaging in discussions, exploring diverse interests, and being
        open to new experiences, I strive to cultivate a balanced perspective
        that goes beyond the boundaries of technology.
